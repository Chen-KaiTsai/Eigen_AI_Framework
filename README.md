# Eigen_AI_Framework
A simple framework implementation practice with both inferencing and training. This work is based on Eigen.

This work is build referencing the following book *Neural Networks from Scratch in Python* https://nnfs.io/ . Please refer to the book and youtube channel for better details.

# Compile and Test
I personally use Windows with Visual Studio 2022 and include Eigen headers. \(https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page\)
